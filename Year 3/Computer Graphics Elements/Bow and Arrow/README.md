## Bow and Arrow ##
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details:
--------------------
Lives appear as 3 red hearts in the upper left.
An arrow appears on the bow and causes it to be fired when the player can shoot.
A white crosshair appears at the mouse cursor.
The speed of the arrow is represented in 3 ways:
1) Power Bar that is initially blue and grows, becoming purple when the maximum speed is reached.
2) The tip of the arrow which is initially yellow and turns red by passing through orange.
3) The bow thread that is initially white and becomes purple when the maximum speed is reached.

The score is displayed in the console.
There are 6 levels that introduce various elements.
Each level has lists of targets mapped using the second they spawn.
At the beginning of each level clues and explanations are printed.
The player has the ability to stop time for a limited time.
During this period they can move, rotate and shoot.
Arrows and targets do not move. The screen will turn green.
The top bar is golden when the time stop can be activated.
After it is activated its length decreases until it is 0, and time will resume.
The bar will turn gray and increase until time can be stopped again, and it will turn golden again.
